## NEWS API PROJECT

## News API

This is a news API built on React. The project is using New York Times' API to collect news articles. The app will have a search bar to aggregate news articles related to the search query. The app will also feature different news sections such as business, world, U.S., health, etc. On the homepage, I plan to feature popular news from the current day, which is part of the NY Times' popular article API.

## Components

I plan to have a search bar component, which will direct the user to a new page based on their search parameters.

The other components/pages will be news split into specific topics such as world news, U.S. news, health, finance, business, sports, etc. Each section or topic will represent a new component.
